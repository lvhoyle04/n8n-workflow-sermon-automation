# YouTube Shorts Workflow Overview

This workflow extracts short-form video clips (under 60 seconds) from full-length sermon videos.

## Workflow Steps

1. Input: YouTube video URL or MP4 file
2. Send to a Shorts-generation AI tool (e.g., OpusClip, Vizard, Pictory)
3. Receive clips (drafts or final versions)
4. Upload to YouTube as unlisted shorts or store in middleware

## Use Cases

- Increase sermon engagement with short clips
- Reach younger or mobile-first audiences
- Repurpose old sermons into fresh content
